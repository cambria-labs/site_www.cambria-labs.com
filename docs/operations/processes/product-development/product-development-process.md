## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
A minimum-viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to be able to be released to a subset of potential customers and gather feedback on the product. The MVP is a concept that originated in the Lean Startup methodology, and is used as a way to quickly test and validate product ideas.

The team uses the MVP to gather feedback from users, and iterate on the design based on what they learn. By focusing on building an MVP first, and then iterating based on user feedback, the team is able to validate their assumptions about the product and ensure that they are building something that meets the needs of their customers.
