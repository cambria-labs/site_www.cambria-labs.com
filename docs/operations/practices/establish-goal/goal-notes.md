The establishment of a goal is the key to success. The most important step toward achieving an objective is first to define it. 

Make a list of everything you want.

Dedicate thirty minutes a day in which to list your thoughts about possible goals, for 30 days. At the end of that time, choose from the possible objectives you have listed the one that seems most important, and record it separately on a single card. Carry this card with you at all times. Think about this objective every day. Create concrete mental images of the goal, as if you’ve already accomplished it.

Focus on one objective at a time. Like a servo-mechanic, the brain, set on a target, will call into play those mental processes that will bring your efforts to fruition. Your actions will conform to your expectations, thereby brining about the event. If you believe that you will reach your objective, you will continue to work at a task until you have accomplished it.

Whatever you’re looking for must first be found within you, whether it be peace, happiness, riches or great accomplishments. Everything we do outwardly is only an expression of what we are inwardly.
