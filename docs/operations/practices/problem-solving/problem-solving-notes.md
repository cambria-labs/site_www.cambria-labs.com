# How to Solve Problems

Problems are challenges to creative minds. Without problems, there would be little reason to think at all. It’s a waste of time to worry about problems. Wisely invest the same time and energy in solving problems.

The creative person utilizes an organized approach to problem-solving, or avoids problems altogether by anticipating them and taking creative action before things turn sour.

Avoiding problems is not the same as solving them - we ought to focus on solving problems. 

## Define The Problem

- Say it out loud - "The problem is this: X. I am solving this problem." "We need to solve this, the problem is X".
- Take a piece of paper, write the name of the problem at the top of the page

## Understand the problem
- Facts. What do we know?
- Context
- Constraints
- What don't you know?
	- Questions to ask
	- Who knows?
- Trade-offs
- Related problems - find solutions to similar problems.
- Write it all down.
- Research existing papers
- Look critically at other solutions
- Evalate two or more possible solutions
	- Benefits and drawbacks of each
- What are you asked to find or show?
- Can you restate the problem in your own words?
- Can you think of a picture or a diagram that might help you understand the problem?
- Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?
- Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
- Do you need to ask a question to get the answer?

## Plan
- Guess and check
- Make an orderly list
- Eliminate possibilities
- Use symmetry
- Consider special cases
- Use direct reasoning
- Solve an equation
- Look for a pattern
- Draw a picture
- Solve a simpler problem
- Use a model
- Work backward
- Use a formula
- Be creative

## Do
This step is usually easier than devising the plan. In general, all you need is care and patience, and necessary skills. Persist with the plan that you have chosen. If it continues not to work, discard it and choose another. 


## Focus
- Sit in Hammock, not in front of computer
- You can't do everything, let go.
- Communicate with people, let them know you are going to be unavailable

## Awake mind
- Analysis
- Tactics (short term decisions)
- Finds local maxima
- Use waking mind time to feed work to background mind
- Analyze ideas

## Background Mind
Mind's Eye Time - Sit somewhere, have no input, close your eyes. 

- Good at making connections
	- Synthesis
	- Strategy
	- Abstracts, analogizes
- Solves non-trivial problems
- Find hidden relations among memories, and try to solve problems with it
- Thinking of problems during the day, gives the problem an agenda to the background mind

Draw pictures
Sleep on it
Take a break from it
Switch - Try to work on one thing per day, then switch to another thing
Write it down - Capture the results of the background process
Try ideas
"I know what my challenges are, therfore I can work on them."

You will be wrong. You will think of better ideas. 
Do not be afraid of being wrong.




Take a shower, a walk, play a game, let it stew in the background, sometimes for days. 

The subconscious system is always processing ideas, integrating external unrelated stimuli while you're doing something else (commonly called _thinking outside the box_.) The more difficult the problem, the least effective pointed focus is to solve it. You can't think outside the box if you're putting all your effort on the box. Go do something else.

Conscious thought and focus is but a very small part of our intelligence. Learn to delegate some tasks to your background process.

Get good at problem solving. 

## Retrospective
- Look back on your work. How could it be better?
