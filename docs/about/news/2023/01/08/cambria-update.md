# Cambria Labs Team update
Published: 2022-01-08



## Learn
### What is a Makerspace? 
"A makerspace is a physical location where people gather to share resources and knowledge, work on projects, network, and build. Makerspaces provide tools and working room in a community environment—a library, community center, private organization, or campus. Many are primarily used for **technological experimentation, hardware development, and idea prototyping, but increasingly, self-directed individual inventors and creative teams** are using makerspaces to build projects in fields other than engineering and technology. Makerspaces are zones of self-directed learning, providing a physical laboratory for **inquiry-based learning** and validating the drive for discovery that defines the researcher and the scholar."  -https://library.educause.edu/resources/2013/4/7-things-you-should-know-about-makerspaces

## Books —> Knowledge Base (KB)
As our team reads useful books, we like to put the wisdom & suggestions into practice. While reading a book, underline the good stuff - wisdom, actions & routines. Then, when finished reading the book, go back and review the underlined portions, and add them to the team knowledge base and processes. We all learn & benefit from each other. 

We are interested in reading & processing these books next:
