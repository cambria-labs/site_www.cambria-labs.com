-   We become what we think about.
- You are creative person who anticipates achievement. You expect to win.
- The reality we experience will be that of our own creation. Our individual worlds will respond to us in the way in which we see them. They will become for us that which we expect of them. We are the creators of our own surroundings.

he establishment of a goal is the key to successful living. And the most important step toward achieving an objective is first to define it. I’m sure you have at least thirty minutes a day in which to list your thoughts about possible goals. Set aside such a period each day for a month. At the end of that time, choose from the possible objectives you have listed the one that seems most important, and record it separately on a single card. Carry this card with you at all times. Think about this objective every day. Create concrete mental images of the goal, as if you’ve already accomplished it.
