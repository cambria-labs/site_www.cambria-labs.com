## Looking for

He reaches out for ideas, respects the minds of others, and gives credit to others. Many people have ideas; they’re free, and many of them are excellent.

He is always looking for better ways to do his work and live his life.

## Got one
When a creative person gets a new idea, he puts it through a series of steps designed to improve it. He builds big ideas from little ones, new ideas from old ones.

The creative person knows the value of giving himself and his ideas away. He’s a giver as well as a go-getter. The hand that gives, always gathers.

## Organizing
Create a set of topic folders, then drop ideas into the appropriate folder you think of of them. In a surprisingly short time, there is enough material to write a truly excellent book.
