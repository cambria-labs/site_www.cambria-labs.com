# Success

The person who succeeds is the person who is progressively realizing a worthy ideal. This is a person who says ‘I’m going to become this,’ and then begins to work toward that goal. 

Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.

We become what we think about.

Avoid thinking about what it is you fear. Each time a fearful or negative thought comes into your consciousness, replace it with a mental picture of your positive and worthwhile goal.

![](https://pxl.host/lcnzpwsec7e2td8w6hb.png)Take control of your mind. It will think only about what you permit it to think about. All you have to do is know where you’re going. In addition to maintaining a cheerful, positive outlook, give of yourself more than you have ever done before. Do this knowing that your returns in life must be in direct proportion to what you give.

Success is not the result of making money; making money is the result of success—and success is in direct proportion to our service.

Your success will always be measured by the quality and quantity of service you render. You’ve got to be of service before we can expect a return. No man can get rich himself unless he enriches others.

Success is the product of daily  [habits](habits.md)—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.
