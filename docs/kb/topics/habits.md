# Habits

Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

- Habits are the compound interest of improvement.
- If you want better results, focus on your system.
- Focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.

Four Laws of Behavior Change
	1. (1) make it obvious
	2. (2) make it attractive
	3. (3) make it easy, and
	4. (4) make it satisfying.

Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: **cue**, **craving**, **response**, and **reward**

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe

With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.

It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

Ask yourself: ‘Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?’

The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.

Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.

One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.

The habit stacking formula is: ‘After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

The two most common cues are Time and Location.

Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.

“The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”

Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.

“The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

Motivation is Overrated -  Environment Often Matters More.

Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.

People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the motivation spike.

Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do

We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.”

We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: **the close (family and friends)**, **the many (the tribe)**, and **the powerful (those with status and prestige)**.”

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to **join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior** and (2) **you already have something in common with the group.**

The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.

Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.

The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.

We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.

Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.

“Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.

“Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.

Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.

The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.

Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.

A commitment is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.

The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.

Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.

We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way.

Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.

We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.

An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.

**humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.**

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.

When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.

The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they’re too heavy to be broken.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who _wants_ this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who _is_ this.

Start at the identity level first and then build out from there. The _how_ and the _what_ components will naturally follow once you figure out the _who_ part. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.

Little things add up to big things. Tiny actions, multiplied by millions can produce massive results. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

Successful people and unsuccessful people have the same goals. The goal cannot be what differentiates the successful people from the unsuccessful people. Having goals is not enough. Whether we succeed or fail depends on the quality of the system we develop to help us make progress once we’ve chosen a direction. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You rise to the level of your system.

If and when you achieve goals, it’s not because you _set_ them, it’s because you set up the proper system to achieve them. If you want to see results, i.e. achieve your goals, you ought to worry far more about your system than anything else.
